This meets the criteria: “Your app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using JSON-server. Your API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes.”

Event Listeners
As a user, I want to be able to 
     - Search: Allow users to search for specific clothing items by name.
     - Filter: Enable users to filter clothing items by category (e.g., shirts, pants) or price range.
     - Sort: Implement sorting functionality to arrange clothing items based on price or popularity.

Stretch goal: The user will also be able to buy the items.

Links to an external site. (3 events of different types). This would count as the first event listener, click.

Technical notes
Single-page web application
This meets the criteria: Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.
API: db.json file. I   create my own db json file using a frameowk from https://fakestoreapi.com/docs .

This meets the criteria: Your app must be an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using json-server.
Array iteration method: forEach.
This meets the criteria: Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc).
Challenges I expect to face
I don’t know how to create a serach funciton. I don’t know what items I want to use to interate. I don’t know how to dsplay itmes using CSS. I have some basic knowlecge of flex box, but I might need to impvoe on this to be able to make the display effective. I will find it chalengeding to use Js effectively to ge the website to be more interactive..
